            <h2>Spoon's Adoption Story</h2>
        
            <p>We adopted Spoons from a local animal shelter when he was a 3-month-old kitten back in 2020. He was energetic and loved stealing all kinds of human food- even broccoli! In this photo, he was exploring the inside of my family's Little Free Library.</p>

            <p>Spoons is now 3-years-old and is as silly and problematic as ever. His favorite activities include playing fetch, napping, and hanging out with his puppy friends.</p>
